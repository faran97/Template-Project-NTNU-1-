\subsection{Task 1.2}
\textbf{Task 1.2: Present the differences between the original formulation of the Denavit-Hartenberg(DH) convention, as presented in [1], and the modified version as presented in Appendix C in MR}

Main difference between the modified version is the choice of reference frame, where we start analyzing our link and joint

The second difference is how the calculation of the translated and rotated frame is, and it is given by the following formula

!Show exactly what the difference is with an example, and show what different formula is used. And thats it!


\eqref{eq:Incompressible Navier-Stokes} shows the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using tensor notation.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} + u_j \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial P}{\partial x_i} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_j^2}
    \label{eq:Incompressible Navier-Stokes}
\end{equation}
